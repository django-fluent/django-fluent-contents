.. _commentsarea:

The commentsarea plugin
=======================

The `commentsarea`  plugin displays the form and messagelist
that django-contrib-comments_ (or django.contrib.comments_) renders.

  .. figure:: /images/plugins/commentsarea-admin.*
     :width: 732px
     :height: 61px

The displays a list of comments, with a comments area below:

  .. image:: /images/plugins/commentsarea-html.*
     :width: 470px
     :height: 500px

By default, the displayed comments will look very plain. This is however, not an accident.
The django.contrib.comments_ module provides these defaults to make it fully customizable
to the design and workflow of the web site where it is being used.
Hence, this plugin depends on a properly configured django.contrib.comments_ module.

.. tip::

    For an advanced plug&play setup, you can use the django-fluent-comments_ application
    which includes features such as Ajax-based posting. Make sure to include it's
    JavaScript and CSS files somewhere in the page.


Installation
------------

Add the following settings to ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'django_comments',
        'fluent_contents.plugins.commentsarea',
    )

The django.contrib.comments_ module also requires a location for it's pages.
Add the following to ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns += [
        url(r'^blog/comments/', include('django_comments.urls')),
    ]

This URL can be anything off course, like ``/comments/``, ``/respond/comments/`` or ``/blog/comments/`` for example.

.. note::
   As of Django 1.8, the django.contrib.comments_ module is no longer bundled with Django.
   It's provided as separate application that can be installed from PyPI.

   For older Django projects, replace ``django_comments`` with ``django.contrib.comments`` in the example above.


Configuration
-------------

After the installation, each page can be enriched with a comments area.
Posting a comment however, produces an almost blank page.
That's because ``comments/base.html`` should be overwritten.

To get a usable comments module, the least you need to do, is providing two templates:

* ``comments/base.html``
* ``comments/posted.html``

.. note::
    As with other plugins of *django-fluent-contents*, the output of the plugin is cached.
    Only when a comment is posted, the output will be refreshed. To change templates in a development/runserver
    environment, set :ref:`FLUENT_CONTENTS_CACHE_OUTPUT` to ``False`` in the settings.


The base.html template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``comments/base.html`` template is used by every template of the comments module.
It needs to provide two blocks;

* **title**: the sub title to display in the ``<title>`` tag.
* **content**: the content to display in the ``<body>`` tag.

These blocks can be mapped to your site template.
It's contents could be something like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "mysite/base.html" %}{% load i18n %}

    {% block headtitle %}{% block title %}{% trans "Responses for page" %}{% endblock %}{% endblock %}

    {% block main %}
              <div id="content" class="clearfix">
                {% block content %}{% endblock %}
              </div>
    {% endblock %}

The :file:`comments/base.html` file can be stored in the :file:`templates` folder of your site theme.


The posted.html template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final "Thank you for posting" page is also quite plain.
Replace it be something more fresh by overriding the :file:`comments/posted.html` template.
For example, try something like:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends "comments/base.html" %}{% load i18n %}

    {% block title %}{% trans "Thanks for commenting" %}{% endblock %}

    {% block extrahead %}
    {{ block.super }}
        <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="5; url={{ comment.content_object.get_absolute_url }}#c{{ comment.id }}" />
    {% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
        <h1>Thank you for responding</h1>
        <p>
          We have received your comment, and added it to the web site.<br />
          You will be sent back to the article...
        </p>

        {# Using identical formatting to normal comment list #}
        <dl id="comments">
          <dt id="c{{ comment.id }}">
            {{ comment.submit_date }} - {{ comment.name }}
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>{{ comment.comment }}</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p><a href="{{ comment.content_object.get_absolute_url }}#c{{ comment.id }}">Back to the article</a></p>
    {% endblock %}

The template now contains links back to the blog page, and no longer appears as dead end.
It will automatically redirect back to the blog in a few seconds.


Additional configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The django.contrib.comments_ module can be further extended with other modules.
In fact, django.contrib.comments_ only establishes a standard methodology for integrating comments to a Django site.
The framework also supports moderation, flagging, and RSS feeds too. More documentation can be found at:

* `Django's comments framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/>`_
* `Customizing the comments framework <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/custom/>`_
* `Example of using the in-built comments app <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/example/>`_

Some Django applications already implement these features. For example:

* django-fluent-comments_, which includes:

 * Ajax-based previews and posting of comments.
 * Comment moderation, and Akismet_ based filtering.
 * E-mail notifications.
 * `django-threadedcomments <https://github.com/HonzaKral/django-threadedcomments>`_

* `django-comments-spamfighter <https://github.com/bartTC/django-comments-spamfighter>`_
* `django-myrecaptcha <https://bitbucket.org/pelletier/django-myrecaptcha/>`_

These modules can enhance the commentsarea even further.
